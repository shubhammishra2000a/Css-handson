    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="lt">CSS is not necessary</span><span class="p">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. </li>
        <li><span class="uli">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to addd CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="p">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS selectors are used to target a specific element orr range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. </p>
